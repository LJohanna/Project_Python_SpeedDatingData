# Project_Python_SpeedDatingData
This project uses a database from Kaggle, constituted from speed dating sessions data, between 2002 and 2004. The goal was to predict the "match" between two persons using the data collected. We had to deal with the complex structure of the data, and we built classical models (logistic regressions, decision trees and gradient boosting decision trees). We dealt also with the "imbalanced" character of the data, and used a more balanced dataset to get better results from the models.
